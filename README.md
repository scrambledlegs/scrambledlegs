- 👋 Hi, I’m @scrambledlegs
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, bioinformatics, and making my life harder by using CLI whenever possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R to work on gene expression data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nonsensical and useless projects.
- 📫 How to reach me? Ask nicely, I guess.
